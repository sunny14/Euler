1. Given a csv file, sort it by its key field EFFICIENTLY.
The program should never have more than X number of records in memory.
The key index and the max number of records are read as input arguments.

2. Design a performance improvement using parallel processing.

3. Add JDBC code which inserts the sorted file into database. Assume all fields are strings.
